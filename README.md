# backend faker
Uses express to set up a fake "backend" that will return JSON generated by faker.

## new stuff
backend-faker now supports nested backend structures. Yay!

## installation
Run `npm install backend-faker` in your project directory.

## usage
NOTE: This only supports GET at the moment!

Create a `backend.json` file in your project folder. `backend.json` sample:
```json
[
    {
        "/fake/response/:id": {
            "first_name": "firstName",
            "company_name": "companyName"
        }
    }
]
```

Run with `backend-faker`

Each value nested under a path is the name of a faker method. Available faker methods can be found [here](http://marak.com/faker.js/)

Following the former example, a call to `/fake/response/123` would produce
```json
{"first_name": "SomeFirstName", "company_name": "Random Company Name"}
```

### lists
You can request a list of generated data by including a `_LIST_` key followed by the maximum number of items you want in the list.
```json
[
    {
        "/i/want/a/list/of/stuff/:id": {
            "_LIST_": 20,
            "first_name": "firstName",
            "last_name": "lastName"
        }
    }
]
```

### joins
You can join ids of two requests by including a `_JOIN_` value containing a previously defined path.
```json
[
    {
        "/list/of/profiles/:id": {
            "_LIST_": 20,
            "id": "number",
            "first_name": "firstName",
            "last_name": "lastName"
        }
    },
    {
        "/profile/:id": {
            "_JOIN_": "/i/want/a/list/of/stuff/:id",
            "id": "number",
            "profilePic": "avatar",
            "email_address": "email",
            "country": "country"
        }
    }
]
```
In this case, a request to `/profile/:id` (provided with an id found in `/list/of/profiles/:id`) would join the two responses before returning.
